## Description
##
##
## This requires dcm.pl
## it also requires a version of <manufacturer>_cmd to get the configs from the devices
## all must be in the path somewhere
## also requires sendEmail to send out notificaitons
## it also uses the command md5sum

Usage: `basename $0` -h <hostname|IP> or -f <FILE> -d [-m <manufacturer>]

  Required
    -h:  FQDN or IP of the host to archive configurations for
   OR
    -f:  Path to filename containing list of FQDN or IPs to archive

  Optional
    -d:  Enable debug logging
    -m:  Force a manufacturer name, determines method to contact device with

Description:
  Give either the -h or -f option as an input to what host(s) to archive
configurations for.  The host must exist in the database.  The script will
try to determine which connection script to use based on the manufacturer
defined in the device model setting of this device.  You can specify the
-m option to force the manufactuer.  If you wish to skip a host, add
a custom attribute type of "disable_cfg_archive" with a value of Y.
